üìè Unit Converter ‚Äî Beginner JavaScript Project
This project is part of my ongoing journey to become a software engineer. I created this unit converter to practice working with DOM manipulation, event listeners, and conditional logic using JavaScript.

I leaned on ChatGPT for support while building this ‚Äî not for copy/pasting blindly, but to help me understand how things work, why they're written a certain way, and how to structure responsive, functional code. Every time I added or changed something, I made sure to pause, experiment, and learn from it.

The calculator-style layout was a fun design choice that I plan to iterate on as I grow more confident with CSS and UI design principles.

This may be a small project, but it represents a big milestone: building something functional from start to finish, asking for help when needed, and continuing to move forward.
