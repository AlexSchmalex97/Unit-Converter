📏 Unit Converter — My First JavaScript Project
This is a simple unit converter that converts miles to kilometers and vice versa.
I built it early in my journey learning JavaScript to practice basic concepts like
working with the web page using DOM manipulation, handling user input, and
responding to events.

I used ChatGPT to help explain and guide me through parts of the code, which
helped me understand how JavaScript interacts with web pages. The design is
inspired by a calculator layout, and I’m excited to keep improving it as I learn more.

This project represents an important step in my growth as a programmer—building
something real while learning and asking for help.
